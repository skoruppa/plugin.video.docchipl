An addon for Kodi that allows users to watch anime with Polish subtitles from the [**Docchi.pl**](http://docchi.pl) site. This project is a port of mine **[original Stremio addon](https://github.com/skoruppa/docchi-stremio-addon)**, bringing its core logic to the Kodi platform.

---

## Key Features

- **Access to Docchi.pl Catalogs**: Browse anime from the current season, view trending series, and see the latest released episodes.
- **Rich Metadata from Kitsu**: All lists are enhanced with detailed information such as descriptions, ratings, premiere dates, genres, and posters thanks to integration with the Kitsu API.
- **Detailed Episode Information**: The episode list includes individual titles, synopses, and thumbnails when available from Kitsu.
- **Intelligent Caching**: The addon uses a local SQLite database to cache ID mappings and metadata, which drastically speeds up loading times on subsequent visits.

## Installation

There are two installation methods: the recommended one (using the repository for automatic updates) and a manual one (for a single installation).

### Recommended Installation (from the Docchipl Repository)

This method is recommended as it provides **automatic updates** for the addon whenever a new version is released. It's a two-step process: first, you install the repository, and then you install the addon from it.

#### Step 1: Install the Docchipl Repository

1.  Add `skoruppa.github.io/plugin.video.docchipl` as a file manager's source or download the repository ZIP file by clicking the link below:
    *   [**repository.docchipl.zip**](https://skoruppa.github.io/plugin.video.docchipl/repository.docchipl.zip)
2.  Open Kodi and navigate to: **Add-ons -> Add-on browser (the box icon)**.
3.  Select **Install from zip file**.
4.  Select the added source or locate the downloaded `repository.docchipl.zip` file and confirm the installation.
5.  Wait for the notification confirming the repository has been installed successfully.

#### Step 2: Install the Docchi.pl Addon

1.  In the same Add-on browser, select **Install from repository**.
2.  Select **Docchipl Repo** from the list.
3.  Go to the **Video add-ons** category.
4.  Select **Docchi.pl** from the list and click **Install**.
5.  After a moment, the addon will be installed and available in **Add-ons -> Video add-ons**.

### Alternative Method (Manual Installation from ZIP file)

You can install the addon manually, but please note that this method **does not provide automatic updates**.

1.  Navigate to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/skoruppa/plugin.video.docchipl/releases) section of this GitHub page.
2.  Download the latest version of the addon as a `.zip` file (e.g., `plugin.video.docchipl-0.2.3.2.zip`).
3.  Open Kodi and navigate to: **Add-ons -> Add-on browser (the box icon)**.
4.  Select **Install from zip file**.
5.  Locate the `.zip` file you just downloaded and confirm the installation.
6.  After a moment, the addon will be installed and available in **Add-ons -> Video add-ons**.

## How It Works (Architecture)

The addon uses a hybrid approach, combining data from two sources to provide the best possible user experience:

- **Docchi.pl API**: Serves as the primary source of truth for which anime and episodes are available, and for fetching the list of stream links.
- **Kitsu.io API**: Used to fetch all rich metadata‚Äîboth for entire series (descriptions, genres, ratings, artwork) and for individual episodes (titles, synopses, thumbnails).
- **Local Database (SQLite)**: The addon intelligently saves fetched metadata to a local database. This ensures that when you reopen a list, the data loads almost instantly without needing to query the APIs again.

## Supported Players
